// The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using standardized protocols. It provides the infrastructure for data exchange, enabling various services such as email, file sharing, and web browsing. The internet is not limited to any specific application or service; it is a vast network that supports multiple protocols and technologies.
// A web browser, on the other hand, is a software application that allows users to access and interact with content on the internet. Browsers interpret and render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display web pages, enabling users to navigate the web, view multimedia content, and interact with web applications. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
// The key difference is that the internet is the underlying network infrastructure, while a web browser is a tool that enables users to access and interact with content on that network. Without the internet, web browsers would have no content to display, and without web browsers, users would have no way to access the content available on the internet.
